# -- NOTE -- ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#
#   This implementation improves vanilla (a.k.a. sequential) image quilting speed via parallelization.
#
#   The following is a reference to the source implementation contained in the jena2020 folder:
#       https://github.com/rohitrango/Image-Quilting-for-Texture-Synthesis
#
#   And the original algorithm paper:
#       https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/papers/efros-siggraph01.pdf
#
#   Conceptually, parallelization is done by creating a horizontal and vertical stripes in the shape of a cross
#   dividing the image into 4 sections that can be generated independently.
#   Additionally, each section's rows can also be "generated in parallel" ( clarifications below in 2.2 ).
#
#   The operations are as follows:
#   1.
#       2 stripes for each direction are generated, all in parallel (if enough cores available).
#       1 vertical and 1 horizontal stripes are created with inverted images, in order to re-use the original
#       implementation methods without any additional modifications.
#
#   2.1
#       The 4 separate sections are generated at the same time, using the required inversions,
#       and then flipped at the end so that all can be stitched together
#
#   2.2
#   An OPTIONAL parallelization step is implemented, but improvement is not significant.
#   ( also, can be worse in small generations, with a low number of patches or small source image )
#   While generating each section, instead of generating each row sequentially, multiple rows "can run in parallel" in
#   alternating fashion. The modulo of the row number is run by the job with that number, e.g.:  if using two jobs,
#   one runs the odd rows and another the even rows.
#   Note that one row section CAN ONLY be computed ONCE THE ADJACENT SECTION IN THE PRIOR ROW HAS BEEN COMPUTED.
#   The algorithm is still sequential in nature, this is not some "modern" variant of the algorithm,
#   but it does not require a row to be completely filled in order to compute some of the next row's patches.
#
#   3.
#   Stitching is straightforward, and only needs to take into account the removal
#   of the shared components belonging to the initially generated stripes.
